# A Comprehensive Project

Welcome to my project repository where I work with dataset of books using Excel, Python, R, SQL and Power BI.

## About the Dataset

The "Books" dataset contains information about more than 10 thousands books, extracted from the Goodreads website through the website API.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Power BI

## Project Overview

In this project, I wanted to follow a Data Analyst workflow, starting from retrieving the data, cleaning the data, creating a database and creating meaningful visualizations. I used Microsoft Excel to get familiar with the dataset, then I did some
data cleaning, preprocessing, and an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Python and R. Then, I created the database amd imported the refined dataset into Power BI to make some visualizations.

## Web Scraping: a New Challenge

During the project, I came across a difficult challenge. Noticing that all information about the books' genres was missing, I decided to retrieve it using the API, which, unfortunately, had been made unavailable by Goodreads from 2020. I had to find a different way and eventually
resorted in doing a bit of "web scraping" from different websites: Wikipedia, Google Books, Open Library and Goodreads.


## Repository Structure
- The file "books.csv" contains the raw data used for the project.

- The file "cleaned_genres.csv" contains the cleaned dataset with the new column for the genres.

- The file "books.ipynb" contains the Python code used to import the data and perform data cleaning.

- The file "genres.ipynb" contains the Python code used to do the web scraping using the isbn as the key.

- The file "Books_with_R.R" is the R studio file with the code for the statistical analysis of the data.

- The file "Dashboard Books.pbix" is the Power BI file with the interactive dashboard.

- The file "Project Presentation.pptx" is a Power Point summary of all the steps taken while working with the dataset from beginning to end.
